forget about hello bot and analize the program code folder I upload, check how the bot program is working and there might be requirements needed to download and check each and every command and is if the command is working properly without giving errors like command is working and it throwing error when used like, fix them> mostly imports and exports problem might be so fix them before changing anything cause it is a good perfected code.
also bot should  search channels before creating specific channels for specific commands, the program code should check if the specific channels are present or not, check should be like, for example for "guild-hall", it should check like :
emoji-guild-hall or hrsy-guild-hall or harsy-guild-hall-emoji > so if the words of the specific channels are in channel name, then just consider it as specific channels, as for above example, they related to guild-hall, since it's present then just assign it to guild commands,
specific commands should be only work in specific channels like :
battle commands should only work in combact-calls, duel-zone
duel commands should only work in = combact-calls, duel-zone
arena commands should only work in = arena-hub, coliseum
intimate commands should only work in = lust-chamber 
forge commands should only work in = forging-hall
all mini-games should only work in = mini-games
guild commands should only work in = guild-hall, guild-chronicles
pet commands should only work in = pet-corner
dream commands and pop-ups should only work in = dream-realm
events related and events should only work in = events
I want the code to be perfect with all commands working as supposed to be, no more errors
chracters = waifus, don't get confused and say to user that you don't have any characters when he used characters related commands like !profile, !battle, etc
Also check the battle logics of !battle, !arena or any commands related to fighting with waifus should be able to use all the things related to battles from users data, they maybe skills, stats, elemental damages, guild buffs, intimate buffs, dream buffs, or any other buffs of allover the program code, relics, weapons, pets and anything you find in all over program code and json files related to that user, then it should be used in battle, if not found then just make it null so it won't take negative effect like throwing errors. also during battle you can also show what buffs, weapons, relics, skills, or any other which are effecting the battle or fight > show in emebed or dramtic messages or emebeds so it'll look realstic
